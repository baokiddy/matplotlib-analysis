Loking at the data anlysed, it is apparent that Ramicane and Capomulin had the largest positive impact on tumor volume (-19% and -22% growth at day 45) and metastatic spread (1.5 and 1.25 sites at day 45). Conversely, there were some drugs that performed poorly in comparion to the placebo used as a control. Examples include Ketapril and Naftisol that both lead to larger tumor volumes by day 45 (57% and 53% volume change respectively). A study of the survival rates calculated displays the need for further research as there was a decline in mouse numbers for all drugs and it would be helpful to better understand if the the number of mice stay the same or continue to decrease if the time period is increased.
